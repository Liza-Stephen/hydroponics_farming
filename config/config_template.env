# Databricks Configuration
# This file is for local testing only
# In Databricks, set these as environment variables in your Job configuration

# REQUIRED: Unity Catalog catalog name
DATABRICKS_CATALOG=your_catalog

# Optional: Source data path in Volumes (defaults to /Volumes/{catalog}/bronze/raw_data/iot_data_raw.csv)
# SOURCE_DATA_PATH=/Volumes/your_catalog/bronze/raw_data/iot_data_raw.csv

# Note: 
# - Code runs natively in Databricks via Repos and Jobs
# - Data should be stored in Unity Catalog Volumes before running
# - Create a Databricks Job to run the pipeline
# - Set DATABRICKS_CATALOG as an environment variable in the job configuration

# Note: The pipeline automatically creates and uses three schemas in Unity Catalog:
# - {catalog}.bronze schema (table: iot_data)
# - {catalog}.silver schema (table: iot_data)
# - {catalog}.gold schema (tables: iot_data, dim_time, dim_equipment)
